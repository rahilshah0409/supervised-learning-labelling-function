# Supervised learning of the labelling function
Using image segmentation on snapshots of WaterWorld (OpenAI Gym environment) states to create a labelled dataset of WaterWorld states with overlapping balls in said state. This dataset is utilised for supervised learning, using an MLP to map states to arbitrary events in the WaterWorld environment (defined as the overlapping of any two balls).
