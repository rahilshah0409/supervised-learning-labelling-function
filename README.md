# Image segmentation experimentation
Using image segmentation on snapshots of WaterWorld (OpenAI Gym environment) states to create a labelled dataset of WaterWorld states with overlapping balls in said state. This dataset will be utilised for supervised learning, using an MLP or CNN to map states to arbitrary events in the WaterWorld environment (defined as the overlapping of any two balls).
